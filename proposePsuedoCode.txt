Initialize all men and women to free
while there exist a free man m who still has a woman w to propose to 
{
    w = m's highest ranked such woman to whom he has not yet proposed
    if w is free
       (m, w) become engaged
    else some pair (m', w) already exists
       if w prefers m to m'
          (m, w) become engaged
           m' becomes free
       else
          (m', w) remain engaged    
}

while (knight is-not-in married[]):
    arr[] = knightPrefs["knight"]
    lady = arr[0] 

    if(lady is-not-in married[])
       (knight, lady) added to married[]

    else some pair (knight2, lady) already exists
        if lady prefers knight to knight2
            (knight, lady) become engaged
            (knight2, lady) removed from married[]
        else
            (knight2, lady) remain engaged
